00:00:00,04 --> 00:00:04,03
- [Instructor] We're staying in our Geometry.DWG file

2
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:07,03
and we're going to take a look at polylines,

3
00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:10,02
polygons and splines.

4
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,05
A polyline is a group of lines

5
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:14,09
joined together to form one object.

6
00:00:14,09 --> 00:00:17,04
A polygon is a multi-sided shape

7
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:21,01
and a spline is an irregular curve in AutoCAD.

8
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:22,08
And we're going to work through

9
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:26,03
each of those commands to see how they work within AutoCAD.

10
00:00:26,03 --> 00:00:28,00
We're also going to work with a couple of other commands,

11
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:30,00
but you'll see that as we go as well,

12
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:31,04
because often what happens

13
00:00:31,04 --> 00:00:33,09
is you work with one particular command in AutoCAD

14
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:35,06
and then you might work with another one

15
00:00:35,06 --> 00:00:36,09
just to update something

16
00:00:36,09 --> 00:00:40,08
with that particular geometrical object that you've created.

17
00:00:40,08 --> 00:00:42,05
I'm going to roll back on the wheel

18
00:00:42,05 --> 00:00:46,05
a couple of notches like so and just pan down a little bit.

19
00:00:46,05 --> 00:00:48,08
So you'll notice we've got a bit of space here

20
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:51,09
in this area where we created this table

21
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:54,01
with the two circular inserts there.

22
00:00:54,01 --> 00:00:56,05
So I'd like you to zoom in on that area

23
00:00:56,05 --> 00:00:58,08
just above your table there like so.

24
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:01,00
So you've got a bit of space here.

25
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:04,07
Make sure you're still using the FFE furniture layer,

26
00:01:04,07 --> 00:01:07,05
that one there, A700_M_FFE.

27
00:01:07,05 --> 00:01:10,05
And then we're going to go to the Home tab on the ribbon

28
00:01:10,05 --> 00:01:12,01
and we're going to go to the Draw panel

29
00:01:12,01 --> 00:01:15,09
and we're going to click on this Polyline command here like so.

30
00:01:15,09 --> 00:01:17,03
We come into the drawing area

31
00:01:17,03 --> 00:01:21,05
and the dynamic input prompts us for a start point

32
00:01:21,05 --> 00:01:24,00
just like the Line command.

33
00:01:24,00 --> 00:01:27,02
Now hopefully, down here on the status bar,

34
00:01:27,02 --> 00:01:29,07
you've still got your polar tracking running

35
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:32,04
and set at your 90 degrees

36
00:01:32,04 --> 00:01:35,00
and you've still got your object snap tracking

37
00:01:35,00 --> 00:01:36,06
and your object snaps on as well.

38
00:01:36,06 --> 00:01:37,07
They should all still be the same

39
00:01:37,07 --> 00:01:39,09
if you haven't made any changes.

40
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:41,04
Now I'm going to click about here,

41
00:01:41,04 --> 00:01:44,00
click once and I'm going to drag upwards.

42
00:01:44,00 --> 00:01:47,09
Now just like the Line command with the polar tracking,

43
00:01:47,09 --> 00:01:49,09
you'll see there that I can drag upwards

44
00:01:49,09 --> 00:01:51,07
and I can get that polar tracking line

45
00:01:51,07 --> 00:01:54,00
kicking and going vertically like so.

46
00:01:54,00 --> 00:01:54,08
So with that there,

47
00:01:54,08 --> 00:01:59,04
I'm going to type in my 1500 and press Enter.

48
00:01:59,04 --> 00:02:01,04
And that gives me that vertical segment.

49
00:02:01,04 --> 00:02:03,04
Remember when we did this with the Line command?

50
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:06,07
Now we're doing this this time with the Polyline command.

51
00:02:06,07 --> 00:02:08,06
So I'm going to drag across to the right now.

52
00:02:08,06 --> 00:02:11,08
There's the right hand polar tracking line kicking in.

53
00:02:11,08 --> 00:02:15,00
And again I'm going to do the 2500,

54
00:02:15,00 --> 00:02:17,01
which you'll remember from previous videos.

55
00:02:17,01 --> 00:02:19,02
So that gives us that horizontal part

56
00:02:19,02 --> 00:02:21,09
of our new table that we're creating.

57
00:02:21,09 --> 00:02:23,09
I come vertically down again

58
00:02:23,09 --> 00:02:25,07
and again with the polar tracking,

59
00:02:25,07 --> 00:02:29,02
I type in the 1500 and press Enter.

60
00:02:29,02 --> 00:02:31,02
And just like with the Line command,

61
00:02:31,02 --> 00:02:35,06
I can now right click and I can close.

62
00:02:35,06 --> 00:02:37,01
So you'll note that that looks

63
00:02:37,01 --> 00:02:39,00
just like other tables that we've drawn

64
00:02:39,00 --> 00:02:43,02
but using the Line command rather than the Polyline command.

65
00:02:43,02 --> 00:02:46,04
So what's the difference between a table of that shape,

66
00:02:46,04 --> 00:02:50,06
a rectangular table but using the Polyline command?

67
00:02:50,06 --> 00:02:54,06
Well, the Polyline command converts it to all one object.

68
00:02:54,06 --> 00:02:55,08
So if I click on that now,

69
00:02:55,08 --> 00:02:59,04
can you see it's all one object instead of four lines?

70
00:02:59,04 --> 00:03:02,00
If I hover over it, you'll notice there, if I hover there,

71
00:03:02,00 --> 00:03:05,02
it's a polyline on that particular layer.

72
00:03:05,02 --> 00:03:07,07
I'll hit Escape there just to deselect it.

73
00:03:07,07 --> 00:03:11,00
So what you've seen there now is three different methods

74
00:03:11,00 --> 00:03:13,03
of creating that rectangular table.

75
00:03:13,03 --> 00:03:15,04
Initially we use the Rectangle command,

76
00:03:15,04 --> 00:03:18,03
then we use four lines with the polar tracking.

77
00:03:18,03 --> 00:03:20,07
And this time, we've used the Polyline command

78
00:03:20,07 --> 00:03:22,04
with the polar tracking.

79
00:03:22,04 --> 00:03:23,07
So three different ways

80
00:03:23,07 --> 00:03:27,03
to create a similar geometrical object.

81
00:03:27,03 --> 00:03:31,02
We're going to zoom in a little now on the rectangular table

82
00:03:31,02 --> 00:03:33,01
and I'm going to make sure it fills the screen like that

83
00:03:33,01 --> 00:03:36,02
'cause I want you to see what I'm doing for the next bit.

84
00:03:36,02 --> 00:03:37,09
There's quite a few object snaps

85
00:03:37,09 --> 00:03:39,06
that we're going to be working with.

86
00:03:39,06 --> 00:03:42,06
Now I'm going to create a circle first.

87
00:03:42,06 --> 00:03:45,09
So staying on the same layer, Draw panel again,

88
00:03:45,09 --> 00:03:47,08
click on the flyout for the circle

89
00:03:47,08 --> 00:03:50,07
and you want Center Radius.

90
00:03:50,07 --> 00:03:54,03
Click on Center Radius and come back into the drawing area.

91
00:03:54,03 --> 00:03:56,04
Now you'll remember in previous videos,

92
00:03:56,04 --> 00:03:58,06
we used our object snap tracking,

93
00:03:58,06 --> 00:04:01,03
our O track or auto snap is it's name.

94
00:04:01,03 --> 00:04:02,09
And what I'm going to do,

95
00:04:02,09 --> 00:04:04,05
I'm going to hover here over this midpoint snap.

96
00:04:04,05 --> 00:04:07,06
Remember, do not click.

97
00:04:07,06 --> 00:04:10,03
I'm then going to hover here over this midpoint snap,

98
00:04:10,03 --> 00:04:13,02
and again, I'm not going to click.

99
00:04:13,02 --> 00:04:15,09
As I drag down, you'll see the intersection

100
00:04:15,09 --> 00:04:18,04
between the two polar tracking lines.

101
00:04:18,04 --> 00:04:21,08
Then left click and there's the center of your circle

102
00:04:21,08 --> 00:04:24,06
at the intersection of those two midpoints.

103
00:04:24,06 --> 00:04:27,08
Now the radius of the circle this time is going to be 600.

104
00:04:27,08 --> 00:04:30,09
Type in a radius of 600 and press Enter.

105
00:04:30,09 --> 00:04:32,05
And there's our circle.

106
00:04:32,05 --> 00:04:34,04
Now the reason I've drawn a circle

107
00:04:34,04 --> 00:04:36,07
is because I want to take you to the next command

108
00:04:36,07 --> 00:04:38,08
that we're going to look at in this particular video,

109
00:04:38,08 --> 00:04:41,08
which is the Polygon command.

110
00:04:41,08 --> 00:04:45,05
Now the Polygon command is incredibly useful.

111
00:04:45,05 --> 00:04:48,06
You can create polygons, multi-sided shapes,

112
00:04:48,06 --> 00:04:53,07
from three sides all the way up to 1,024 sides.

113
00:04:53,07 --> 00:04:57,03
Now I don't know what a 1,024 sided polygon is called.

114
00:04:57,03 --> 00:04:59,03
You might need to check the internet for that.

115
00:04:59,03 --> 00:05:02,06
The most I've gone to is 12 sides, a dodecahedron.

116
00:05:02,06 --> 00:05:05,00
So let's have a look at this Polygon command.

117
00:05:05,00 --> 00:05:06,07
It's up here on the Draw panel,

118
00:05:06,07 --> 00:05:09,09
and you'll remember there's a little flyout command there

119
00:05:09,09 --> 00:05:12,08
next to the Rectangle command.

120
00:05:12,08 --> 00:05:16,02
So that flyout command or flyout triangle,

121
00:05:16,02 --> 00:05:18,06
flyout menu, whatever you want to call it,

122
00:05:18,06 --> 00:05:20,08
shows us two different commands there.

123
00:05:20,08 --> 00:05:23,07
You want Polygon this time on that little menu.

124
00:05:23,07 --> 00:05:26,01
And then it asks for the number of sides.

125
00:05:26,01 --> 00:05:30,03
Hexagon is six sides, so we type in six and press Enter.

126
00:05:30,03 --> 00:05:32,03
Now there are three types of polygon.

127
00:05:32,03 --> 00:05:36,03
You've got inscribed, circumscribed and edge.

128
00:05:36,03 --> 00:05:38,08
You can see edge there on the command line.

129
00:05:38,08 --> 00:05:42,00
It also appears on the shortcut menu if you right click.

130
00:05:42,00 --> 00:05:44,07
An edge polygon purely takes the distance

131
00:05:44,07 --> 00:05:47,04
between two points and makes it the length

132
00:05:47,04 --> 00:05:49,05
of one of the sides of your polygon.

133
00:05:49,05 --> 00:05:50,07
Now we're not going to do that one.

134
00:05:50,07 --> 00:05:52,07
We're going to use inscribed initially.

135
00:05:52,07 --> 00:05:54,07
So we want the center of our polygon.

136
00:05:54,07 --> 00:05:56,06
As per the prompt there

137
00:05:56,06 --> 00:05:58,02
with the the dynamic input on the screen,

138
00:05:58,02 --> 00:06:00,05
I'm going to hover over the edge of the circle.

139
00:06:00,05 --> 00:06:02,02
You'll see the center snap appear

140
00:06:02,02 --> 00:06:04,03
because we've got that object snap switched on.

141
00:06:04,03 --> 00:06:06,04
Or you can just come into the center of the circle

142
00:06:06,04 --> 00:06:08,00
and there's the center snap again.

143
00:06:08,00 --> 00:06:10,02
Left click on the center snap

144
00:06:10,02 --> 00:06:13,05
and it now gives you the option of Inscribed In Circle

145
00:06:13,05 --> 00:06:15,07
or Circumscribed About Circle.

146
00:06:15,07 --> 00:06:18,07
We're going to use Inscribed initially like so

147
00:06:18,07 --> 00:06:20,09
and there's my hexagon.

148
00:06:20,09 --> 00:06:23,00
Now as I come vertically upwards,

149
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:24,06
you'll see that I can utilize

150
00:06:24,06 --> 00:06:26,09
my vertical polar tracking line,

151
00:06:26,09 --> 00:06:28,05
or I could go to the right

152
00:06:28,05 --> 00:06:31,01
and use a horizontal polar tracking line.

153
00:06:31,01 --> 00:06:33,02
Don't go off like this or at a weird angle

154
00:06:33,02 --> 00:06:35,06
'cause then your hexagon doesn't look quite right.

155
00:06:35,06 --> 00:06:37,01
I'm going to go for vertical

156
00:06:37,01 --> 00:06:39,06
and left click on that intersection there

157
00:06:39,06 --> 00:06:41,04
with my polar tracking line.

158
00:06:41,04 --> 00:06:46,07
And now we've got a nice hexagonal insert in my table.

159
00:06:46,07 --> 00:06:48,03
Now that's a hexagonal insert

160
00:06:48,03 --> 00:06:52,07
that is inside the circle, hence the term inscribed.

161
00:06:52,07 --> 00:06:54,09
You might want it outside the circle,

162
00:06:54,09 --> 00:06:56,07
which is known as circumscribed.

163
00:06:56,07 --> 00:06:59,04
So let's delete that particular hexagon like so.

164
00:06:59,04 --> 00:07:00,09
I'll click on it like so.

165
00:07:00,09 --> 00:07:02,08
Now if you hover over a hexagon,

166
00:07:02,08 --> 00:07:05,01
you'll notice you might get this weird little menu here.

167
00:07:05,01 --> 00:07:06,04
This is all to do with grips

168
00:07:06,04 --> 00:07:08,00
and vertices and things like that.

169
00:07:08,00 --> 00:07:09,03
You can ignore that.

170
00:07:09,03 --> 00:07:11,04
Just move away from any of the grips,

171
00:07:11,04 --> 00:07:14,02
right click and select Erase.

172
00:07:14,02 --> 00:07:15,09
Now what you can do as well

173
00:07:15,09 --> 00:07:18,03
is you can in AutoCAD right click

174
00:07:18,03 --> 00:07:20,07
and go back to Recent Input.

175
00:07:20,07 --> 00:07:22,09
And you'll notice Polygon is on the list there,

176
00:07:22,09 --> 00:07:24,03
so I can select it there

177
00:07:24,03 --> 00:07:26,08
instead of going up to the ribbon if you want to.

178
00:07:26,08 --> 00:07:28,09
Click on Polygon, number of sides is six,

179
00:07:28,09 --> 00:07:30,04
it's remembered that from last time.

180
00:07:30,04 --> 00:07:33,02
So I'll just press Enter to confirm the six.

181
00:07:33,02 --> 00:07:36,00
I'll go back to the center snap, touch on the circle.

182
00:07:36,00 --> 00:07:38,00
There's the center snap.

183
00:07:38,00 --> 00:07:39,04
Left click on the center snap,

184
00:07:39,04 --> 00:07:42,00
and this time I'm going to go Circumscribed.

185
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:43,08
So if I go vertically upwards this time,

186
00:07:43,08 --> 00:07:46,01
can you see when I get that intersection there

187
00:07:46,01 --> 00:07:47,06
with the polar tracking,

188
00:07:47,06 --> 00:07:50,04
can you see the hexagon is outside the circle,

189
00:07:50,04 --> 00:07:53,01
circumscribed about the circle?

190
00:07:53,01 --> 00:07:55,06
And if I click, you can see there the hexagon

191
00:07:55,06 --> 00:07:58,03
is a bit bigger than the circle this time.

192
00:07:58,03 --> 00:08:00,02
So if you're happy with that, again,

193
00:08:00,02 --> 00:08:03,04
you could have gone to the right using the horizontal snap

194
00:08:03,04 --> 00:08:06,04
on the circle here if you wanted to going that way.

195
00:08:06,04 --> 00:08:09,02
It's entirely up to you which way you go.

196
00:08:09,02 --> 00:08:11,05
What I'm going to do now is select the circle,

197
00:08:11,05 --> 00:08:15,01
don't need it anymore, right click, Erase.

198
00:08:15,01 --> 00:08:16,04
So zoom out slightly now,

199
00:08:16,04 --> 00:08:18,09
you can see I've got a nice polyline

200
00:08:18,09 --> 00:08:21,03
forming the rectangular table

201
00:08:21,03 --> 00:08:23,07
and there's my hexagonal insert

202
00:08:23,07 --> 00:08:26,04
formed by, again, a polyline,

203
00:08:26,04 --> 00:08:29,09
but using the Polygon command.

204
00:08:29,09 --> 00:08:33,05
If I just roll back a bit now and pan across,

205
00:08:33,05 --> 00:08:35,02
you'll notice, up here,

206
00:08:35,02 --> 00:08:37,05
can you see we've got a green wall?

207
00:08:37,05 --> 00:08:40,02
So you want to go past this column here

208
00:08:40,02 --> 00:08:42,01
and past this group of four chairs

209
00:08:42,01 --> 00:08:44,00
of the little coffee table.

210
00:08:44,00 --> 00:08:46,02
You want to see this little corner of the wall here.

211
00:08:46,02 --> 00:08:48,07
So there's our table we've just created.

212
00:08:48,07 --> 00:08:50,01
It's up there,

213
00:08:50,01 --> 00:08:51,08
sort of upwards to the right.

214
00:08:51,08 --> 00:08:53,07
Zoom in a bit,

215
00:08:53,07 --> 00:08:55,06
pan across a bit like that.

216
00:08:55,06 --> 00:08:58,01
And as you can see, we've got some space there

217
00:08:58,01 --> 00:09:00,01
above these tables and chairs.

218
00:09:00,01 --> 00:09:02,00
And we're going to take a look now

219
00:09:02,00 --> 00:09:05,01
at creating what is known as a spline.

220
00:09:05,01 --> 00:09:07,09
Now don't worry about the layer this is going to go on.

221
00:09:07,09 --> 00:09:09,01
It's going to be a wall, obviously.

222
00:09:09,01 --> 00:09:10,08
It's not going to be a piece of furniture.

223
00:09:10,08 --> 00:09:12,08
We can use a thing called Match Properties

224
00:09:12,08 --> 00:09:14,03
to tweak that later.

225
00:09:14,03 --> 00:09:16,02
Don't worry, we'll do that in a minute.

226
00:09:16,02 --> 00:09:18,03
What I want you to do is go up here

227
00:09:18,03 --> 00:09:21,01
to Measure on the Utilities panel.

228
00:09:21,01 --> 00:09:22,04
It's on the Home tab on the ribbon,

229
00:09:22,04 --> 00:09:25,08
so click on the flyout and go to Distance.

230
00:09:25,08 --> 00:09:29,02
Click on Distance and zoom in on this corner a bit

231
00:09:29,02 --> 00:09:32,03
and click on the little internal corner there

232
00:09:32,03 --> 00:09:34,06
and come vertically up very gently.

233
00:09:34,06 --> 00:09:36,09
And you'll see an intersection there like so.

234
00:09:36,09 --> 00:09:38,08
When you click on that intersection,

235
00:09:38,08 --> 00:09:41,03
it tells you the thickness of that wall,

236
00:09:41,03 --> 00:09:44,09
which is 120.65 millimeters.

237
00:09:44,09 --> 00:09:45,08
I think what we'll do,

238
00:09:45,08 --> 00:09:49,02
we'll just leave that as 120 millimeters for now.

239
00:09:49,02 --> 00:09:50,05
So I'm just going to click on Exit

240
00:09:50,05 --> 00:09:52,06
to exit the Distance command.

241
00:09:52,06 --> 00:09:54,00
So we know that our wall thickness

242
00:09:54,00 --> 00:09:58,01
needs to be 120 millimeters in this particular case.

243
00:09:58,01 --> 00:10:00,07
Now we're going to create a nice curvy wall

244
00:10:00,07 --> 00:10:03,03
using the Spline command.

245
00:10:03,03 --> 00:10:07,02
Now a spline in AutoCAD is an irregular curve

246
00:10:07,02 --> 00:10:10,04
and it's using what they call NURBS technology,

247
00:10:10,04 --> 00:10:15,03
N-U-R-B-S, non-uniform rational B spline.

248
00:10:15,03 --> 00:10:19,05
And all it's using is a particular mathematical iteration

249
00:10:19,05 --> 00:10:21,07
to create that irregular curve

250
00:10:21,07 --> 00:10:25,01
based on the points that you click on in the drawing area.

251
00:10:25,01 --> 00:10:27,03
Now it does sound really complicated.

252
00:10:27,03 --> 00:10:29,03
It's not when you do it visually.

253
00:10:29,03 --> 00:10:30,09
Let me show you what I mean.

254
00:10:30,09 --> 00:10:32,07
I'm going to go to the Home tab on the ribbon again

255
00:10:32,07 --> 00:10:34,02
and into the Draw panel.

256
00:10:34,02 --> 00:10:36,05
I'm going to click on the little flyout here

257
00:10:36,05 --> 00:10:40,00
and pin open the extra icons on the Draw panel.

258
00:10:40,00 --> 00:10:43,08
Remember I showed you that in the interface for AutoCAD?

259
00:10:43,08 --> 00:10:45,05
So now we've got those extra commands,

260
00:10:45,05 --> 00:10:48,00
you can see we've got some curvy ones just here.

261
00:10:48,00 --> 00:10:50,07
So you'll notice there I've got Spline Fit

262
00:10:50,07 --> 00:10:53,04
and I've also got Spline CV.

263
00:10:53,04 --> 00:10:55,07
That draws a spline with control vertices.

264
00:10:55,07 --> 00:11:00,03
Spline Fit just draws a spline with points, fit points.

265
00:11:00,03 --> 00:11:03,07
So that's the one we're going to click on, Spline Fit.

266
00:11:03,07 --> 00:11:05,05
Come into the drawing area

267
00:11:05,05 --> 00:11:08,04
and it asks you to specify the first point.

268
00:11:08,04 --> 00:11:10,04
Now this is very simple to do

269
00:11:10,04 --> 00:11:12,07
and it doesn't have to be exact either.

270
00:11:12,07 --> 00:11:14,04
Can be a little bit abstract this time.

271
00:11:14,04 --> 00:11:16,03
We're creating a curvy wall,

272
00:11:16,03 --> 00:11:18,06
a bit of an artistic type wall

273
00:11:18,06 --> 00:11:22,02
that separates the atrium entrance reception area

274
00:11:22,02 --> 00:11:24,02
of the building from the offices

275
00:11:24,02 --> 00:11:25,09
in the top part of the floor plan.

276
00:11:25,09 --> 00:11:28,06
And you'll see what I mean when we zoom out in a minute.

277
00:11:28,06 --> 00:11:29,09
But the first point is going to be

278
00:11:29,09 --> 00:11:31,05
this little corner of the wall here.

279
00:11:31,05 --> 00:11:34,05
You'll get an endpoint snap, left click

280
00:11:34,05 --> 00:11:36,07
and then you're going to go up, click,

281
00:11:36,07 --> 00:11:40,00
and down, click and up, click,

282
00:11:40,00 --> 00:11:43,03
and down, click, and then up one more time

283
00:11:43,03 --> 00:11:45,07
and I'm going to click again there like so.

284
00:11:45,07 --> 00:11:47,03
I then press Enter

285
00:11:47,03 --> 00:11:52,01
and that draws my nice curvy spline fit.

286
00:11:52,01 --> 00:11:54,03
Now if I zoom out a bit now,

287
00:11:54,03 --> 00:11:56,00
you'll see that we're kind of putting

288
00:11:56,00 --> 00:11:57,06
a separation wall there,

289
00:11:57,06 --> 00:12:00,08
because we've got a staircase, we've got some restrooms

290
00:12:00,08 --> 00:12:03,08
and lifts, elevators, stairs, et cetera.

291
00:12:03,08 --> 00:12:04,06
And what we want to do

292
00:12:04,06 --> 00:12:06,06
is just kind of separate that out a little bit

293
00:12:06,06 --> 00:12:09,02
so it's kind of like a little bit of a separation wall.

294
00:12:09,02 --> 00:12:11,07
I'll zoom back in again now.

295
00:12:11,07 --> 00:12:13,06
Now what we need to do to give that thickness,

296
00:12:13,06 --> 00:12:15,05
is we need to offset it.

297
00:12:15,05 --> 00:12:18,08
Now we can unpin the Draw panel.

298
00:12:18,08 --> 00:12:21,09
I'm going to go to Offset here on the Modify panel.

299
00:12:21,09 --> 00:12:24,03
So I click on Offset,

300
00:12:24,03 --> 00:12:25,07
come into the drawing area

301
00:12:25,07 --> 00:12:27,02
and you'll remember the thickness of the wall

302
00:12:27,02 --> 00:12:29,01
was 120 we decided on.

303
00:12:29,01 --> 00:12:33,08
So I press Enter after putting in that 120 offset distance.

304
00:12:33,08 --> 00:12:37,03
I then select my spline that I've drawn, click on it,

305
00:12:37,03 --> 00:12:40,04
move downwards for offset direction

306
00:12:40,04 --> 00:12:43,02
and left click again to confirm that direction.

307
00:12:43,02 --> 00:12:45,00
Press Enter to finish,

308
00:12:45,00 --> 00:12:48,05
and you can see now that we've got a nice curvy wall

309
00:12:48,05 --> 00:12:51,05
that is 120 millimeters thick.

310
00:12:51,05 --> 00:12:53,06
Now it does need a little bit of tidying up.

311
00:12:53,06 --> 00:12:56,08
So what we're going to do, we're going to zoom in on this end,

312
00:12:56,08 --> 00:12:59,00
use the Line command

313
00:12:59,00 --> 00:13:03,02
and just go endpoint, left click, to endpoint, left click.

314
00:13:03,02 --> 00:13:04,02
Enter to finish.

315
00:13:04,02 --> 00:13:06,02
That closes off the wall.

316
00:13:06,02 --> 00:13:07,05
And then if we just do a little bit

317
00:13:07,05 --> 00:13:10,04
of zooming and panning and zoom in here,

318
00:13:10,04 --> 00:13:11,07
you can see we've got a little bit of a gap.

319
00:13:11,07 --> 00:13:14,03
So if I go up to the Modify panel again,

320
00:13:14,03 --> 00:13:16,07
click on this little flyout here next to Trim

321
00:13:16,07 --> 00:13:19,01
and select Extend.

322
00:13:19,01 --> 00:13:22,08
I can then click on the end of that there and click.

323
00:13:22,08 --> 00:13:24,03
Enter to confirm

324
00:13:24,03 --> 00:13:25,09
and we've extended that to the wall.

325
00:13:25,09 --> 00:13:27,05
So if I zoom out now,

326
00:13:27,05 --> 00:13:29,02
you can see that looks like it's fixed

327
00:13:29,02 --> 00:13:31,08
to the corner of this wall here.

328
00:13:31,08 --> 00:13:33,00
So that Extend command,

329
00:13:33,00 --> 00:13:34,03
we look at that in more detail

330
00:13:34,03 --> 00:13:36,06
in the AutoCAD Essential Training course,

331
00:13:36,06 --> 00:13:37,06
by the way, as well.

332
00:13:37,06 --> 00:13:39,06
I'm just giving you a little bit of a taster of it here

333
00:13:39,06 --> 00:13:41,07
in the Learning AutoCAD course.

334
00:13:41,07 --> 00:13:44,08
Last but not least, we're going to do Match Properties.

335
00:13:44,08 --> 00:13:47,05
Now this is again on the Home tab on the ribbon.

336
00:13:47,05 --> 00:13:49,00
It's in the Properties panel here

337
00:13:49,00 --> 00:13:51,09
and you click on Match Properties.

338
00:13:51,09 --> 00:13:53,09
I'm going to select one of these lines here

339
00:13:53,09 --> 00:13:55,04
that forms the wall.

340
00:13:55,04 --> 00:13:57,09
That's my source object.

341
00:13:57,09 --> 00:14:02,02
I'm then going to select one and two

342
00:14:02,02 --> 00:14:04,03
and the little line there, three.

343
00:14:04,03 --> 00:14:05,07
Press Enter to finish.

344
00:14:05,07 --> 00:14:07,05
And that's now all on the right leg

345
00:14:07,05 --> 00:14:09,06
'cause we've matched the properties of the wall

346
00:14:09,06 --> 00:14:12,03
to the splines and the little short line

347
00:14:12,03 --> 00:14:13,08
that we drew earlier.

348
00:14:13,08 --> 00:14:15,04
So if I zoom out now,

349
00:14:15,04 --> 00:14:19,01
you can see not only do we have a nice curvy separation wall

350
00:14:19,01 --> 00:14:21,03
for our little atrium area here,

351
00:14:21,03 --> 00:14:24,00
but we've got a nice rectangular table there

352
00:14:24,00 --> 00:14:27,02
using a polyline with a hexagonal insert

353
00:14:27,02 --> 00:14:28,09
using a polygon as well.

354
00:14:28,09 --> 00:14:31,08
So we've covered polylines, polygons,

355
00:14:31,08 --> 00:14:35,00
and splines in this particular video.
