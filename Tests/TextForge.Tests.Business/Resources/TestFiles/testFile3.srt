00:00:00,04 --> 00:00:04,03
- [Instructor] We're staying in our geometry.dwg file,

2
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:07,01
and this time we're going to take a look at polar tracking,

3
00:00:07,01 --> 00:00:11,05
known as polar and ortho, or orthogonal,

4
00:00:11,05 --> 00:00:13,02
as it's sometimes known.

5
00:00:13,02 --> 00:00:14,07
Now I'm going to zoom out slightly

6
00:00:14,07 --> 00:00:17,04
so I'm going to place the crosshair in the center of our table

7
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:19,03
that we created in the previous video,

8
00:00:19,03 --> 00:00:21,04
and literally roll back on the wheel

9
00:00:21,04 --> 00:00:23,06
a couple of notches like that.

10
00:00:23,06 --> 00:00:24,09
And then I'm going to pan across,

11
00:00:24,09 --> 00:00:27,09
hold down the wheel on the mouse and pan across,

12
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:30,08
and zoom in a little bit by rolling up on the wheel

13
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:34,00
a couple of notches, to get into this space here.

14
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:36,04
Use pan like that if you need to adjust slightly.

15
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:39,02
But ideally you want the space between the table

16
00:00:39,02 --> 00:00:43,04
you've just created here and these chairs and tables here.

17
00:00:43,04 --> 00:00:45,02
This is sort of space here.

18
00:00:45,02 --> 00:00:49,04
Now what I'm going to do is create a rectangular table,

19
00:00:49,04 --> 00:00:52,04
the same size as the one we created in the previous video,

20
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:53,04
this one here.

21
00:00:53,04 --> 00:00:54,06
So see that one's a polyline,

22
00:00:54,06 --> 00:00:57,05
'cause we created it using the rectangle command.

23
00:00:57,05 --> 00:01:01,03
We're going to use the line command using polar and ortho

24
00:01:01,03 --> 00:01:03,05
and we're going to go through creating a table

25
00:01:03,05 --> 00:01:06,01
using each of those settings.

26
00:01:06,01 --> 00:01:10,01
Now polar and ortho are located on the status bar,

27
00:01:10,01 --> 00:01:12,06
bottom right of your AutoCAD application window.

28
00:01:12,06 --> 00:01:14,09
So there's polar, it's on at the moment,

29
00:01:14,09 --> 00:01:17,00
and I'd like you to click on the fly out arrow,

30
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:21,09
and change the angle increments to 90 degrees like that.

31
00:01:21,09 --> 00:01:25,01
Now ortho is here, it's off at the moment,

32
00:01:25,01 --> 00:01:28,02
but what we'll do is we'll turn that on in a moment.

33
00:01:28,02 --> 00:01:33,00
Now we're going to use polar tracking to create a table.

34
00:01:33,00 --> 00:01:38,05
Now just make sure that you are using the A_700_M_FFE layer,

35
00:01:38,05 --> 00:01:40,06
it should be there already, but if it isn't,

36
00:01:40,06 --> 00:01:42,03
just click on the fly out here

37
00:01:42,03 --> 00:01:44,02
and make sure that you select that layer.

38
00:01:44,02 --> 00:01:46,00
Click on the name of the layer

39
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:48,04
and that'll make it the current layer.

40
00:01:48,04 --> 00:01:50,06
Now I'm going to go up to the line command,

41
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:52,08
like we did previously, there's the line command

42
00:01:52,08 --> 00:01:55,08
on the draw panel, on the home tab, on the ribbon.

43
00:01:55,08 --> 00:01:58,01
And I'm going to pick a point, say about there.

44
00:01:58,01 --> 00:02:00,09
Again, I'm not worried about coordinates whatsoever,

45
00:02:00,09 --> 00:02:03,04
just pick a point and Left Click.

46
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:05,08
Now as I move out to the right,

47
00:02:05,08 --> 00:02:08,08
can you see I've got a zero degree polar tracking line,

48
00:02:08,08 --> 00:02:10,06
that's the green dashed line,

49
00:02:10,06 --> 00:02:12,02
and I've got a distance there as well

50
00:02:12,02 --> 00:02:15,05
as I move along that polar tracking line.

51
00:02:15,05 --> 00:02:18,09
Now we're going to create a table using polar tracking.

52
00:02:18,09 --> 00:02:20,07
So move the mouse upwards,

53
00:02:20,07 --> 00:02:23,08
and can you see, you get a vertical polar tracking line,

54
00:02:23,08 --> 00:02:25,03
that green dashed line.

55
00:02:25,03 --> 00:02:27,08
So there's my angle of 90 degrees

56
00:02:27,08 --> 00:02:30,06
and there's a distance box highlighted in blue.

57
00:02:30,06 --> 00:02:35,08
In that distance box, type in 1500 and press Enter,

58
00:02:35,08 --> 00:02:40,06
and you've drawn a line at 90 degrees, that is 1500 long.

59
00:02:40,06 --> 00:02:44,02
If you now drag the mouse to the right, horizontally,

60
00:02:44,02 --> 00:02:47,01
you get a horizontal polar tracking line

61
00:02:47,01 --> 00:02:49,01
at another increment of 90 degrees.

62
00:02:49,01 --> 00:02:50,08
This time it's actually zero degrees,

63
00:02:50,08 --> 00:02:52,07
as you can see on the readout.

64
00:02:52,07 --> 00:02:58,06
In the distance box, I've got 2537, I'm going to type 2500.

65
00:02:58,06 --> 00:03:01,07
Press Enter to confirm and there's another line segment,

66
00:03:01,07 --> 00:03:03,06
2500 units long,

67
00:03:03,06 --> 00:03:07,02
going along at that particular polar tracking angle.

68
00:03:07,02 --> 00:03:10,05
If I now drag the mouse downwards from the last point,

69
00:03:10,05 --> 00:03:12,07
I get another polar tracking line,

70
00:03:12,07 --> 00:03:14,04
can you see it going vertically down?

71
00:03:14,04 --> 00:03:17,00
At 270 degrees this time.

72
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:19,08
I'm going to type in 1500 again,

73
00:03:19,08 --> 00:03:22,05
the same length as the line on the left hand side

74
00:03:22,05 --> 00:03:24,00
and press Enter.

75
00:03:24,00 --> 00:03:26,01
Now the good thing is I don't have to worry now

76
00:03:26,01 --> 00:03:27,04
about closing out.

77
00:03:27,04 --> 00:03:29,02
I can just Right Click,

78
00:03:29,02 --> 00:03:31,04
and provided I haven't drawn my line segments

79
00:03:31,04 --> 00:03:35,07
in a weird way, I can close back to where I started from.

80
00:03:35,07 --> 00:03:38,01
So that's using polar tracking.

81
00:03:38,01 --> 00:03:41,08
So I've used angles and distances this time.

82
00:03:41,08 --> 00:03:44,07
Now that's great, but what happens if I want to use

83
00:03:44,07 --> 00:03:49,04
ortho instead to create a similar shaped table?

84
00:03:49,04 --> 00:03:51,05
Okay, so let's take a few steps back.

85
00:03:51,05 --> 00:03:54,01
Now I could use undo up here.

86
00:03:54,01 --> 00:03:57,02
If I use undo here, click there, can you see that?

87
00:03:57,02 --> 00:03:59,08
Undoes all of those lines I've drawn.

88
00:03:59,08 --> 00:04:02,07
It's quicker than selecting them all and erasing them.

89
00:04:02,07 --> 00:04:04,09
So just remember you have got undo,

90
00:04:04,09 --> 00:04:06,06
and because you used just the one instance

91
00:04:06,06 --> 00:04:10,00
of the line command to draw those four lines,

92
00:04:10,00 --> 00:04:13,01
as soon as you hit undo, it gets rid of all four of them.

93
00:04:13,01 --> 00:04:15,03
Now we're going to come down to the status bar

94
00:04:15,03 --> 00:04:19,02
and click on ortho here, or ortho mode as it's known.

95
00:04:19,02 --> 00:04:20,08
Now you'll notice that polar tracking

96
00:04:20,08 --> 00:04:24,00
turns off on the status bar when you do that.

97
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:28,04
You can only run ortho or polar, you can't run both.

98
00:04:28,04 --> 00:04:30,00
You have to have one or the other.

99
00:04:30,00 --> 00:04:33,00
So if ortho is on, polar is off,

100
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:35,01
if polar is on, ortho is off,

101
00:04:35,01 --> 00:04:38,04
you can't have both running at the same time.

102
00:04:38,04 --> 00:04:39,09
So we've now got ortho on.

103
00:04:39,09 --> 00:04:41,05
What does ortho do?

104
00:04:41,05 --> 00:04:45,09
Well, ortho locks me into horizontal or vertical lines.

105
00:04:45,09 --> 00:04:49,03
I can't draw lines at any other angle.

106
00:04:49,03 --> 00:04:53,04
So we should get the same rectangular table

107
00:04:53,04 --> 00:04:56,02
but just using a slightly different drafting setting.

108
00:04:56,02 --> 00:04:59,08
In this case, our ortho mode on the status bar.

109
00:04:59,08 --> 00:05:02,08
So let's go back up to the line command,

110
00:05:02,08 --> 00:05:04,00
come into the drawing area.

111
00:05:04,00 --> 00:05:06,02
Again, it's asking for the first point of the line.

112
00:05:06,02 --> 00:05:07,09
I'm going to Left Click about here,

113
00:05:07,09 --> 00:05:10,05
a similar place to where I started last time.

114
00:05:10,05 --> 00:05:12,05
And as I drag vertically upwards,

115
00:05:12,05 --> 00:05:15,04
you'll notice if I drag from left to right,

116
00:05:15,04 --> 00:05:19,05
the line only moves horizontally, can you see that?

117
00:05:19,05 --> 00:05:21,06
I can only do up and down, left and right,

118
00:05:21,06 --> 00:05:23,04
I can't go anywhere else.

119
00:05:23,04 --> 00:05:28,01
So if I drag upwards like that and type in 1500,

120
00:05:28,01 --> 00:05:31,02
and press Enter like we did with the polar tracking,

121
00:05:31,02 --> 00:05:32,05
and then I drag to the right,

122
00:05:32,05 --> 00:05:34,03
can you see that I'm getting the angle,

123
00:05:34,03 --> 00:05:37,01
but I can't deviate from that horizontal line.

124
00:05:37,01 --> 00:05:39,05
So that's going to be 2500.

125
00:05:39,05 --> 00:05:40,09
Press Enter.

126
00:05:40,09 --> 00:05:42,02
If I come down again,

127
00:05:42,02 --> 00:05:46,02
can you see I can only go vertically or upwards.

128
00:05:46,02 --> 00:05:49,08
So vertically down, vertically up, that's it.

129
00:05:49,08 --> 00:05:53,02
So I type in 1500 again, press Enter.

130
00:05:53,02 --> 00:05:56,02
And again, I can do that Right Click and close thing.

131
00:05:56,02 --> 00:05:58,03
Takes me back to where I started from.

132
00:05:58,03 --> 00:05:59,07
So you can see there

133
00:05:59,07 --> 00:06:03,08
that I've got the same result using polar or ortho,

134
00:06:03,08 --> 00:06:07,01
but they are very different methods of drawing things.

135
00:06:07,01 --> 00:06:09,00
Now the lovely thing about polar

136
00:06:09,00 --> 00:06:11,03
is you can use different angle increments.

137
00:06:11,03 --> 00:06:14,05
You can use 45 degrees, you can use 30 degree increments.

138
00:06:14,05 --> 00:06:17,03
With ortho, you are tied in, in essence,

139
00:06:17,03 --> 00:06:20,04
to the X and Y axis, vertical and horizontal,

140
00:06:20,04 --> 00:06:23,00
that's the only way you can use ortho.

141
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:25,06
So if you've got loads of straight lines to draw,

142
00:06:25,06 --> 00:06:28,03
vertically and horizontally, use ortho.

143
00:06:28,03 --> 00:06:31,00
If you've got lots of lines to draw at specific angles,

144
00:06:31,00 --> 00:06:33,00
I would go with the polar tracking.
