00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:04,02
- [Lecturer] We're staying in our interface dot DWG file.

2
00:00:04,02 --> 00:00:07,02
And in this particular video, we're going to take a look

3
00:00:07,02 --> 00:00:11,07
at the ribbon and ribbon panels in more detail.

4
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:13,09
Now, you can't miss the ribbon in AutoCAD.

5
00:00:13,09 --> 00:00:16,02
It's that big long strip at the top

6
00:00:16,02 --> 00:00:18,03
of the screen there with all the icons on it.

7
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:19,08
So when you've got a drawing open,

8
00:00:19,08 --> 00:00:22,00
all of those icons become available.

9
00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:22,08
They're not grayed out.

10
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:24,08
It means you can work on your drawing,

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:27,07
and obviously generate your designs within AutoCAD.

12
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:30,07
So what I want to show you is how all of these ribbon tabs,

13
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:32,02
ribbon panels, and things work.

14
00:00:32,02 --> 00:00:34,07
So in the ribbon, by default,

15
00:00:34,07 --> 00:00:38,06
you normally start in the home tab right here, top left.

16
00:00:38,06 --> 00:00:40,01
And as I click on these tabs,

17
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:43,03
can you see the ribbon changes each time?

18
00:00:43,03 --> 00:00:45,07
So we've got a different theme for each tab.

19
00:00:45,07 --> 00:00:48,03
So the home tab, the insert tab,

20
00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:51,00
the annotate tab, the parametric tab.

21
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:53,04
Now if you are using AutoCAD LT,

22
00:00:53,04 --> 00:00:55,05
which is the light version of AutoCAD,

23
00:00:55,05 --> 00:00:56,09
your ribbon may look different.

24
00:00:56,09 --> 00:00:58,08
You will have less commands on it

25
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:00,03
because it's the light version

26
00:01:00,03 --> 00:01:03,03
of the full version of AutoCAD, just so you know.

27
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:05,05
But you can see there that if I go to output,

28
00:01:05,05 --> 00:01:07,02
I can plot, I can batch plot.

29
00:01:07,02 --> 00:01:09,08
That's the whole idea of those ribbon tabs.

30
00:01:09,08 --> 00:01:13,03
Now let's go back to that home tab on the ribbon.

31
00:01:13,03 --> 00:01:17,01
Now these ribbon tabs are basically themes.

32
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:19,04
So you can see in the home tab on the ribbon,

33
00:01:19,04 --> 00:01:21,00
we've got ribbon panels

34
00:01:21,00 --> 00:01:27,00
such as draw, modify, annotation, layers, and so on.

35
00:01:27,00 --> 00:01:29,01
Now there is a bit of repetition here.

36
00:01:29,01 --> 00:01:31,01
You'll notice you've got the annotation panel

37
00:01:31,01 --> 00:01:32,05
there on the home tab.

38
00:01:32,05 --> 00:01:34,06
If you go to the annotate tab,

39
00:01:34,06 --> 00:01:37,04
you've got even more annotation tools.

40
00:01:37,04 --> 00:01:40,00
So there is repetition of the same commands

41
00:01:40,00 --> 00:01:42,05
in different panels on the ribbon.

42
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:44,05
I'm going to go back to the home tab now.

43
00:01:44,05 --> 00:01:46,02
Now you'll notice on the ribbon,

44
00:01:46,02 --> 00:01:48,06
there's lots of little white triangles.

45
00:01:48,06 --> 00:01:51,00
They're known as flyout tabs.

46
00:01:51,00 --> 00:01:53,07
So if I go underneath the circle command and click on

47
00:01:53,07 --> 00:01:56,01
the little flyout tab there, see the little triangle,

48
00:01:56,01 --> 00:01:58,03
it'll show me all the different types

49
00:01:58,03 --> 00:02:00,04
of circle commands available

50
00:02:00,04 --> 00:02:02,09
on that draw panel on the ribbon.

51
00:02:02,09 --> 00:02:04,05
It's the same with the art command.

52
00:02:04,05 --> 00:02:05,03
You'll notice it.

53
00:02:05,03 --> 00:02:08,02
There's all the different permutations and combinations

54
00:02:08,02 --> 00:02:10,00
of the art command that you can use

55
00:02:10,00 --> 00:02:13,03
in that draw panel on the ribbon.

56
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:14,05
Now that's incredibly useful

57
00:02:14,05 --> 00:02:16,01
because I can hover over any of these.

58
00:02:16,01 --> 00:02:19,02
Look, you see you've got rectangle, polygon and so on.

59
00:02:19,02 --> 00:02:23,07
And the benefit is, is if I clicked on say, polygon there,

60
00:02:23,07 --> 00:02:25,01
you'll notice that it's asking me

61
00:02:25,01 --> 00:02:27,03
from the number of sides of my polygon, et cetera.

62
00:02:27,03 --> 00:02:29,01
But note on the ribbon,

63
00:02:29,01 --> 00:02:32,00
it's now defaulted to the polygon command.

64
00:02:32,00 --> 00:02:34,01
So if I hit escape now a couple of times

65
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:36,01
and just cancel that polygon command,

66
00:02:36,01 --> 00:02:37,02
next time I go up there,

67
00:02:37,02 --> 00:02:39,02
can you see it's now set to polygon?

68
00:02:39,02 --> 00:02:40,09
To get back to the rectangle command,

69
00:02:40,09 --> 00:02:43,06
I just simply click on the flyout, click on rectangle.

70
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:46,06
It's now asking for the first corner point, my rectangle.

71
00:02:46,06 --> 00:02:48,00
I'll just hit escape a couple of times

72
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:48,09
to cancel the command.

73
00:02:48,09 --> 00:02:50,06
Be aware of that in AutoCAD.

74
00:02:50,06 --> 00:02:53,00
If ever you hit a command that you don't want to use,

75
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:55,07
just hit escape on the keyboard a couple of times.

76
00:02:55,07 --> 00:02:58,01
That cancels not only the command that you are using,

77
00:02:58,01 --> 00:03:00,09
but any objects you might have selected as well.

78
00:03:00,09 --> 00:03:02,06
So you're kind of back to square one,

79
00:03:02,06 --> 00:03:05,06
and you can go back to the command you want to use.

80
00:03:05,06 --> 00:03:09,04
Now these ribbon panels are incredibly useful,

81
00:03:09,04 --> 00:03:10,07
as I've already shown you,

82
00:03:10,07 --> 00:03:12,07
but there's some even more useful bits

83
00:03:12,07 --> 00:03:14,04
in the ribbon panels as well.

84
00:03:14,04 --> 00:03:17,03
So let's go to this little fly out here where it says draw.

85
00:03:17,03 --> 00:03:19,03
If I click on that fly out there,

86
00:03:19,03 --> 00:03:21,09
you'll notice there's even more commands available

87
00:03:21,09 --> 00:03:23,01
in the draw panel.

88
00:03:23,01 --> 00:03:25,05
So there's all these different commands in here as well.

89
00:03:25,05 --> 00:03:30,04
Things such as splines, construction lines and so on.

90
00:03:30,04 --> 00:03:32,05
But if I move away from that,

91
00:03:32,05 --> 00:03:35,01
it disappears back into the ribbon again.

92
00:03:35,01 --> 00:03:37,01
Now you may find that a little bit annoying,

93
00:03:37,01 --> 00:03:39,01
especially if you want to use those commands

94
00:03:39,01 --> 00:03:42,04
in the extended flyout part of the ribbon panel.

95
00:03:42,04 --> 00:03:45,06
So all you do is you click on the little flyout arrow,

96
00:03:45,06 --> 00:03:48,07
click on the little pin there, and that pins it open.

97
00:03:48,07 --> 00:03:50,09
So that one now stay open

98
00:03:50,09 --> 00:03:55,01
until you go to a different ribbon tab.

99
00:03:55,01 --> 00:03:57,09
To unpin it, you simply click on the little blue square

100
00:03:57,09 --> 00:03:59,03
where the pin is,

101
00:03:59,03 --> 00:04:02,05
and it floats back into the ribbon again.

102
00:04:02,05 --> 00:04:04,08
Really, really useful, quick and easy,

103
00:04:04,08 --> 00:04:06,08
and it just allows you to utilize

104
00:04:06,08 --> 00:04:09,01
all of the icons in that ribbon panel.

105
00:04:09,01 --> 00:04:12,03
So modify, if I click there, and click on the pin,

106
00:04:12,03 --> 00:04:13,09
you'll notice there that you can see

107
00:04:13,09 --> 00:04:17,02
that obviously my modify commands are now there

108
00:04:17,02 --> 00:04:19,07
on the screen, ready for me to use.

109
00:04:19,07 --> 00:04:21,08
When I want them to go back into the ribbon,

110
00:04:21,08 --> 00:04:25,03
I just unpin accordingly, like so.

111
00:04:25,03 --> 00:04:28,07
Now I just want to take you through one more clever thing

112
00:04:28,07 --> 00:04:30,09
on the ribbon with the ribbon panels,

113
00:04:30,09 --> 00:04:33,02
and these are known as sticky panels.

114
00:04:33,02 --> 00:04:35,04
Now I love these because I work

115
00:04:35,04 --> 00:04:39,09
on a multiple monitor environment in my office here at home.

116
00:04:39,09 --> 00:04:44,01
So what I want to do is have my sticky panels perhaps

117
00:04:44,01 --> 00:04:46,00
on a different monitor, while I'm working

118
00:04:46,00 --> 00:04:47,04
on my drawing on a different screen.

119
00:04:47,04 --> 00:04:49,08
Now I can't do it while I'm recording the videos for you,

120
00:04:49,08 --> 00:04:52,02
'cause it's all on the one monitor, on the one screen.

121
00:04:52,02 --> 00:04:53,09
But here's where it gets clever.

122
00:04:53,09 --> 00:04:57,00
If I click and hold on the title bar

123
00:04:57,00 --> 00:04:59,07
of the drawing panel, and drag it down,

124
00:04:59,07 --> 00:05:03,00
you'll notice when I release after I've dragged it down here

125
00:05:03,00 --> 00:05:05,08
into the drawing area, it just drops it straight

126
00:05:05,08 --> 00:05:06,09
into the drawing area.

127
00:05:06,09 --> 00:05:08,08
You'll notice that the ribbon is updated.

128
00:05:08,08 --> 00:05:12,07
So modify now is the left most ribbon panel

129
00:05:12,07 --> 00:05:15,06
in the home tab on the ribbon.

130
00:05:15,06 --> 00:05:18,01
Now this is great because it means now

131
00:05:18,01 --> 00:05:20,01
that I can go to a different tab

132
00:05:20,01 --> 00:05:22,07
and still have my draw tools available.

133
00:05:22,07 --> 00:05:26,07
So for example, let's make my current ribbon tab annotate.

134
00:05:26,07 --> 00:05:28,06
So now I can work on the annotation,

135
00:05:28,06 --> 00:05:32,01
perhaps some dimensions, perhaps some labels on the drawing,

136
00:05:32,01 --> 00:05:35,04
but I still got all my draw tools ready to go,

137
00:05:35,04 --> 00:05:38,01
and if I hover over them, I can use them just as I would

138
00:05:38,01 --> 00:05:40,02
in the ribbon at the top of the screen.

139
00:05:40,02 --> 00:05:41,02
Very quick and easy.

140
00:05:41,02 --> 00:05:42,06
If I click there on the flyout,

141
00:05:42,06 --> 00:05:44,04
there's all my circle commands,

142
00:05:44,04 --> 00:05:46,00
click there on the arc flyout ones,

143
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:49,04
there's all my arc commands like I showed you a moment ago.

144
00:05:49,04 --> 00:05:52,09
So that's now floating out in the drawing area.

145
00:05:52,09 --> 00:05:55,05
It's known as a sticky panel.

146
00:05:55,05 --> 00:05:56,04
But here's the thing,

147
00:05:56,04 --> 00:05:59,02
how do I get that back into the ribbon

148
00:05:59,02 --> 00:06:00,01
now it's floating around?

149
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:01,07
I might want it to go back.

150
00:06:01,07 --> 00:06:04,01
Well, all you do is you hover over the sticky panel,

151
00:06:04,01 --> 00:06:05,02
the floating panel.

152
00:06:05,02 --> 00:06:07,09
Can you see there's a little sort of T-shaped icon?

153
00:06:07,09 --> 00:06:12,06
If you hover over that, it says return panels to ribbon.

154
00:06:12,06 --> 00:06:14,01
But hold that thought.

155
00:06:14,01 --> 00:06:17,05
I'm in the annotate tab on the ribbon.

156
00:06:17,05 --> 00:06:20,02
Won't that return the panel to the annotate tab

157
00:06:20,02 --> 00:06:22,06
on the ribbon instead of the home tab on the ribbon?

158
00:06:22,06 --> 00:06:24,05
Well, why don't you try this?

159
00:06:24,05 --> 00:06:26,04
Get that sticky panel on the screen,

160
00:06:26,04 --> 00:06:28,06
like I've got it, and then hover over it

161
00:06:28,06 --> 00:06:30,06
and click on that little T-shaped icon there,

162
00:06:30,06 --> 00:06:32,04
return panels to ribbon.

163
00:06:32,04 --> 00:06:35,04
Now the draw panel has returned to the ribbon,

164
00:06:35,04 --> 00:06:37,06
but here's where AutoCAD's really clever.

165
00:06:37,06 --> 00:06:39,09
It hasn't put it in the annotate tab on the ribbon.

166
00:06:39,09 --> 00:06:41,08
If you go back to the home tab on the ribbon,

167
00:06:41,08 --> 00:06:43,08
it's back where it was before,

168
00:06:43,08 --> 00:06:47,01
in front of the modified panel there on the ribbon.

169
00:06:47,01 --> 00:06:49,03
Very quick and easy.

170
00:06:49,03 --> 00:06:50,09
Now, those sticky panels are great

171
00:06:50,09 --> 00:06:54,02
if you need a ribbon panel from one ribbon tab

172
00:06:54,02 --> 00:06:55,03
to be on the screen

173
00:06:55,03 --> 00:06:58,02
while you're in another ribbon tab doing something else.

174
00:06:58,02 --> 00:06:59,07
Very, very useful.

175
00:06:59,07 --> 00:07:04,02
Now, I just want to take you through one more ribbon setting.

176
00:07:04,02 --> 00:07:07,05
And for new users, when you've never used AutoCAD before,

177
00:07:07,05 --> 00:07:09,05
it can completely freak you out.

178
00:07:09,05 --> 00:07:12,07
Trust me, I've been in many, many AutoCAD classes

179
00:07:12,07 --> 00:07:15,00
where a new user will click on this button,

180
00:07:15,00 --> 00:07:16,07
and they'll suddenly go, "what have I done?

181
00:07:16,07 --> 00:07:18,01
Have I broken AutoCAD?"

182
00:07:18,01 --> 00:07:19,09
You haven't broken AutoCAD.

183
00:07:19,09 --> 00:07:22,04
It's this little white one up here.

184
00:07:22,04 --> 00:07:23,03
Can you see it?

185
00:07:23,03 --> 00:07:25,05
It's a little white button with an arrow.

186
00:07:25,05 --> 00:07:28,03
Now it says minimize to panel buttons.

187
00:07:28,03 --> 00:07:31,07
Now if I click on it, you'll see what happens.

188
00:07:31,07 --> 00:07:33,09
The ribbon changes and it's like, what have I done?

189
00:07:33,09 --> 00:07:35,04
Have I broken AutoCAD?

190
00:07:35,04 --> 00:07:40,04
No. All you've done is you've set up a different setup

191
00:07:40,04 --> 00:07:42,03
for the AutoCAD ribbon.

192
00:07:42,03 --> 00:07:43,02
That's all you've done.

193
00:07:43,02 --> 00:07:45,04
It's a different appearance for the ribbon,

194
00:07:45,04 --> 00:07:47,00
and you've got four different settings.

195
00:07:47,00 --> 00:07:48,00
So this is the first one.

196
00:07:48,00 --> 00:07:50,02
If I click on that little white button again,

197
00:07:50,02 --> 00:07:51,03
there's the next one.

198
00:07:51,03 --> 00:07:52,05
Where if I hover over these,

199
00:07:52,05 --> 00:07:54,02
can you see there's my panels?

200
00:07:54,02 --> 00:07:56,03
And then if I click on it a third time,

201
00:07:56,03 --> 00:07:59,01
it disappears completely and all I've got is the tabs.

202
00:07:59,01 --> 00:08:00,01
But if I click on the tabs,

203
00:08:00,01 --> 00:08:01,06
you'll see there's all the information there.

204
00:08:01,06 --> 00:08:03,09
when I move away, it disappears.

205
00:08:03,09 --> 00:08:05,01
So last but not least,

206
00:08:05,01 --> 00:08:07,06
all I've got to do now is click on that little white button

207
00:08:07,06 --> 00:08:11,06
a fourth time, takes me back to the default ribbon settings,

208
00:08:11,06 --> 00:08:12,09
as you can see.

209
00:08:12,09 --> 00:08:15,06
So don't be afraid if you click on

210
00:08:15,06 --> 00:08:17,09
that little white arrow button there by mistake.

211
00:08:17,09 --> 00:08:19,03
Just keep clicking.

212
00:08:19,03 --> 00:08:21,07
And on that fourth click, so to speak,

213
00:08:21,07 --> 00:08:25,00
you'll be back to your default ribbon settings.
